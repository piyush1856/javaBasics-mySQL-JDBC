------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One to one relationships
One to one reltionship very rarely used reletionship.

Example:

to storing any other  types of documents or identity cards that we previusly valid so we need exactly one
identity card.

one employee can have nly one identity card.
one identity card can belong to only one employee

this is one to one reletionship

One to many relationships

In one to many reltionship we simply add table1 primary key to table2 as foreign key
Imagin That we want to store employee in database for each employee also store department but
in seprate table that time we use one to many relationships.

Example:
Department Table did is primary key we store this in employee table as foreign
+-----+-----------+----------+

|   4 | Marketing | Thane    |
+-----+-----------+----------+

+-------+--------+-----------+------------+--------+--------+
| empid | ename  | address   | mobile     | salary | deptid |
+-------+--------+-----------+------------+--------+--------+
|     1 | sameer | nashik    | 9673182158 |  12000 |      1 |
|     2 | rahul  | pune      | 9973182158 |  11000 |      1 |

Many to many reletionship

In many to many relationships both tables could have multiple rows on the other side.

Example:
 one employee during the time can call many customer also one cutomer during the time
 could recived call from many employess.
 
 We need to create 3 table here
 1.employee
 2.customer
 3.call table(for mainting theÂ relationships).
