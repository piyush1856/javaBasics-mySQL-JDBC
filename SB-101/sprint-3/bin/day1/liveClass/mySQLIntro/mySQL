 
 JAVA : It is mostly used to develop a Business Application
 
 Business Application : 
 
 Business Organization : main objective for any Business organization is Profit.
 	1. Small Scale Business Organization -> Shop, Gas Station etc
 	2. Large Scale  :  HDFC Bank, SBI, Mastercard, Pepsico etc
 				-> Enterprise
 				-> These business organization provides their services ti the client/customer, and to computerize those services whatever
 				   computer application we develop is known as Business Application.
 				   
 				   
 Common General Things in any business organization :
 	
 	1. Storing and maintaining business data in a secure and easily accessible manner.
 	2. Processing that data according to the business rule.
 	3. Presenting the data in user-understandable format.
 	 
 	 
 Note : In real-time application we keep/maintain business data inside RDBMS s/w
 
 Data : It is collection of raw and isolated facts.
 
 Information : When we process the data, then we get meaningful information/result.
 
 Data store : It is a store where we can store or keep our business related data.
  	 	 		 ->	normal book and files
  	 	 		 -> flat file in computer (notepad, word file)
  	 	 		 			- problem of data maintainace
  	 	 		 			- data redundency
  	 	 		 			- data integrity/ inconsistence
  	 	 		 			- security
  	 	 		 			- data retrival
  	 	 		 			
  	 	 		 			to overcome these problem we need to store the data in the DBMS s/w RDBMS software
  	 	 		 			
 				 
 				 -> Database : It is organized collection of interrelated data or structured collection of data.
 				 
 
 DBMS : It is a type of software there we can manage multiple database.
 
 RDBMS : It is also a software which follow a relational model. In this model data is stored in 2-D table.	
 		we have multiple RDBMS software are their : mySQL software (Oracle Corporation)		
 													Oracle software
 													Postgres
 													sql-server (MicroSoft)
 													DB2 (IBM)
 													etc ..
 
 RDBMS is an extension of DBMS software.
 
 
 
 --> MONgoDB : json, nosql : medium level : not a RDBMS but DBMS
 every RDBMS is a DBSM but reverse is not true.  ex - mongoDM

SQL: 
------

--In order to work with RDBMS we need to use SQL (structured query language),
it is an interface by using which we can work with any kind of RDBMS s/w.

Note: Whenever we install any RDBMS s/w then at physical level (in harddisk ) some databases will be created automatically, 

***Each RDBMS s/w has one main component is there which is called as 
"Database engine". which will execute the sql commands.

--to execute any sql command with Database engine we need a client application:

--along with the mysql installation we get the mysql command line client, from where
we can execute any type sql with database engine.

--we can install some GUI client for mysql as well for example, mysql-workbench




--sql is a case insensetive language. but some reservered keywords are case sensitive(user, table,  ).

--sql language is a collection of predefined commands.

these commands are categoriesed into following category:

1. DDL (Data defination language) 
(create, alter, drop, truncate, rename)

2.DML (data manipulation language)
(insert, update, delete)

3.DRL (Data retrival language)
(select)

4. TCL (Transaction control language)
(commit, rollback, savepoint)

5.DCL (Decision control language)
(grant, revoke)




>show databases;

--to list out all the databases in our mysql

>create database web20sb101db;

--after creating the db inside the mysql rdbms s/w we need to move inside that DB.

>use web20sb101db;

>show tables;

> create table student(roll int,name varchar(12),marks int);

>drop table student; 

>create table student
(
roll int,
name varchar(12),
marks int
);


>desc student;



1. DDL (Data defination language) 
(create, alter, drop, truncate, rename)
===============================

datatypes in mysql:
-------------------------

1.numerics types:

2.string types

3.date and time types


1.numerics types:
----------------------
tinyint : 1byte
smallint: 2 byte
mediumint: 3 byte
int : 4 byte
bigint: 8byte

floating point:
----------------

float(6,2): the column can store 6 digit with 2 decimal places

2 string types:
-------------------

1. char : fixed length of string range bt 0 to 255 char

2.varchar : variable length of argument bt 1 to 65500, here we must define the 
length.


char(4)
varchar(4)

value        char(4)       storage_requited

'a'     -----------------> 4 bytes

'ab'  -----------------> 4 bytes

'abcdef' -------------> error, data is too long


	
value        varchar(4)       storage_requited

'a'     -----------------> 1 bytes

'ab'  -----------------> 2 bytes

'abcdef' -------------> error, data is too long


Note: in the term of efficiency, if we r storing with variable length of argument then we should use varchar, and it the length is always fixed then we should use char, here char is slightly faster than varchar.


3. date and time:
-------------------

a. date : yyyy-mm-dd
b. datetime: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss


2. alter :
----------

--it is used to change the structure of the existing table.

--this command having 4 sub-commands:

1. add
2. modify
3. drop
4. change


a. add: it is used to add a new column in the existing table.
ex:-  alter table student add address varchar(15); 
>alter table student add address varchar(15);

b. modify : it is used to change the column datatype or size.
ex: alter table student modify address varchar(20); --> can change size a well as data type
>alter table student modify address varchar(20);


c. drop: to drop a single or multiple columns from a table.
ex: alter table student drop column address;
>alter table student drop column address;

d. change: to rename a column.
ex:alter table student change FullName name varchar(12);
>alter table student change name sname varchar(12);






3. drop :
=======

--to drop/delete the entire table from the database.

>drop table student;

Note : This table cannot be rolled back.




4.truncate :
=========

--this command is used to truncate/clean all the rows/recored from the table
permanently.(Here table structure will not be deleted)

Note: all the DDL  command can not be rolledback.


5. rename:
========

--it is used to rename a table.

ex:

>rename table student to student1;


2.DML (data manipulation language)
(insert, update, delete)
===============================

>select * from student;  // getting all the columns and all the rows from a table

1. insert :
========

--inserting the record in the table:

inserting all the column values:

>insert into student values(10, 'Ram', 850);

inserting partial column values:

>insert into student values(13, 'manoj',null);

or

> insert into student(roll,marks) values(22, 600);
