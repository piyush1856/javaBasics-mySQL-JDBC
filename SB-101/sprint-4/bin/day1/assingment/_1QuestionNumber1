Q1/- What is the requirement of Java Database communication?



Definition of JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) 

JDBC is an API(Application programming interface) used in java programming to interact with databases. The classes and interfaces of JDBC allow the 
application to send requests made by users to the specified database.

Purpose of JDBC 

Enterprise applications created using the JAVA EE technology need to interact with databases to store application-specific information. 
So, interacting with a database requires efficient database connectivity, which can be achieved by using the ODBC(Open database connectivity) driver.
This driver is used with JDBC to interact or communicate with various kinds of databases such as Oracle, MS Access, Mysql, and SQL server database.



RDBMS are excellent in data storage in a secure and easily retrival manner, but it is very poor in processing and presenting the data in user-understandable format.

--Java is excellent in processing the data and presenting the data, but Java is very poor in storing the data 
(In Java we can store the business data permanently using Serialization and Files)

--so inorder to develop a powerfull business application we need to communicate our Java Application with the DB server.

--Java App can do any task only through the method calls and objects, 
these method calls and object are not directly understandable to the DB s/w.

--DB s/w can understands only sql, Java Compiler does not accept the sql syntax directly.

--Inspite of hetergenious platform Java-DB communication is possible through the JDBC.

JDBC is a technology that enables any kind of Java application to communicate with any kind of DB s/w in a standard manner.
