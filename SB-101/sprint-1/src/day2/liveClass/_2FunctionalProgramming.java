	// this concept is introduced in java 1.8
	//function programming is a paradigm, In this a function is treated as value
	// we can assign the entire function in a variable
	// we can pass a function to another function parameter or we can return a function from another function
	
	//Advantages :  less coding, polymorphic and easy to understand
	
	//to achieve the functional programming in java we need a function interface
	// functional interface :- basically an interface, which has only one abstract method
	
	//A functional interface may have 'n' no. of static and default method, it can also have some data members as well(variable)
	//A functional interface can have object class related method also
