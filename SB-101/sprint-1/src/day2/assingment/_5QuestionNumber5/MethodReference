It is a simplified form (short-cut ) of Lambda Expression.
Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method
of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
Instead of creating a Lambda Expression with all the details, with the help of method reference we can
refer an existing class.



Types of Method References:
There are following types of method references in java:
1. Reference to a static method.
		 example : refer to solution of Question Number 2 of this assignment.
		 		
2. Reference to an instance (non-static) method.
		 example : 
		 	_10MethodreferanceDemo d1 = new _10MethodreferanceDemo("just to resolve constructor");
			_11InterfaceForMR i2 = d1 :: fun2;
			i2.sayHello("Welcome");
			
3. Reference to a constructor.
		 example : 
		 	_11InterfaceForMR i3 = _10MethodreferanceDemo :: new;
			i3.sayHello("Constructor calling reference");
