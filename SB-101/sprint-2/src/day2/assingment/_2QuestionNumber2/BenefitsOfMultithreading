What are the benefits of using Multithreading?



Advantages of Java Multithreading:
1. It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the
same time.
2. You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
3. Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.


Some of application areas to apply multithreading:
To develop multimedia graphics
To develop animations
To develop video games
To develop Web Servers



Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing):
Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
A process is heavy weight.
Day14: Multithreading, Executor Framework 2
The cost of communication between the process is high.
Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps,
updating lists, etc.




Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading):
Threads share the same address space.(a thread is a part of a process)
A thread is lightweight.
The cost of communication between the thread is low.
