	 * If very few lines of the code requires synchronization then it is not recommended to declare entire method as
		synchronized. we have to enclose those few lines of the code in synchronized block.
		
		In a method, assume 10000 lines code is there, and in the middle somewhere few line need some Database
		operation like(update/delete/add) then declaring entire method as synchronized is a worst kind of programming. here
		it degrades the performance.
		
		
		The main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is ,it reduces the waiting time of the threads
		and improves the performance of the application.
