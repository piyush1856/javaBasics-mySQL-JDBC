Inter-thread Communication or Thread-synchronization:


It means two synchronized threads communicate each other.

Two synchronized thread can communicate each other by using some methods present in Object class, those
methods are wait(), notify(), notifyAll().

By using above methods we can gain partial control on the scheduling mechanism which is supervised by the
thread-scheduler.

To gain this partial control the threads should have a sign of mutual understanding between them .they should be
able to communicate with each other.

Whenever we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally then we use wait() method.
Whenever we need to resume a suspended(waiting) thread then we use notify() method.

In the inter-thread communication the thread which require updation it has to call wait() method.
The thread which performing updation it will call notify() method, so that waiting thread will gets the notification
and it continues its execution with those updation.

Note:- we can call wait(), notify(),notifyAll() only in the synchronized block or synchronized methods.
otherwise we will get a runtime exception.

To call wait() or notify() method on any object we must have that particular object lock otherwise we will get a
runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.

Once a thread calls wait() method on any object, first it releases the lock immediately of that particular object and
then it enters into the waiting state immediately.

Once a thread calls notify() method on any object it also releases the lock of that object but not immediately.
Wait and notify or notifyAll method belongs from Object class because "a thread" can call these methods on any
java object.
