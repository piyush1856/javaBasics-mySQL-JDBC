Java Thread Pool : 
Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.

In the case of a thread pool, a group of fixed-size threads is created. A thread from the thread pool is 
pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, the thread is contained in the thread pool again.
Better performance It saves time because there is no need to create a new thread.
