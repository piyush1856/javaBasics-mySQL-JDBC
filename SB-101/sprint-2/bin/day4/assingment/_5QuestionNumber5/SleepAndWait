Sleep() :
The Sleep () method is related to the Thread class that is used to stop the 
execution of the current Thread for few seconds. The Sleep () method takes the 
sleeping time in milliseconds. The monitor's ownership is not lost when we use the 
Sleep () method and start the execution again from where it stops. In simple words,
 the Sleep() method is responsible for sending the current Thread into
  the "Non Runnable" state.
  
  It is a static method.
  At the time of the Synchronization, the Sleep() method doesn't release the obj, i.e., lock.
  We can call the Sleep () method from outside the Synchronized context.
  
  
  
  
 Wait() : 
 The Wait() method is related to the Object class. The Wait() method is responsible
 for sending the calling thread into the waiting state. The Thread remains in the 
 waiting state until another thread doesn't invoke the notify() or notifyAll()
 method for that object. The Thread resumes the execution after obtaining the
 ownership of the monitor.
 
It is not a static method.
At the time of the Synchronization, the Wait() method releases obj.
We can call the Wait () method only from the Synchronized context.
