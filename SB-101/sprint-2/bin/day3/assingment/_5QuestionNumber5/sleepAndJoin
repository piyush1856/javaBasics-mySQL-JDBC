Suspending a thread based on time:
There is a static method by name sleep(long ms) inside the Thread class which takes time in milliseconds as an
argument
Example:
 Thread.sleep(1000);
This method will suspend the current thread which is under execution with those many millisecond passed as
argument(1000ms=1sec).
This sleep method is proven to generate checked exception hence it must be called inside try and catch block.
Note : we cannot use throws with run() method, it will violate the method override rule.
The main reason is that there's no-one to catch the exception, except for any catch-all handlers you might register
with your  Thread or the containing  ThreadGroup



Suspending a thread conditionally:
join() method
If we want to suspend a running thread conditionally then we should use join() method of the Thread class.
The join() method is a non-static method.
If a thread wants to wait until completion of other thread then we should use join() method.
If a thread t1 calls join() method on another thread t2, like t2.join() then t1 thread will be enter into waiting state
until t2 thread completes.
Letâ€™s assume that we have two threads available t1 and t2.
now if we have a condition that inside run() method of t1 we need to use some of the values calculated in run()
method of t2,then in this case we have to stop the execution of run() method of t1 until the run() method of t2 is
completely executed. in such situation we have to make use of join() method.
