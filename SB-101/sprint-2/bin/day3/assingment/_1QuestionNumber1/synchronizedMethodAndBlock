 What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
 
 
 
 Java is a multi-threaded programming language and there is a higher risk to occur race conditions. Because the
same resource may be accessed by multiple threads at the same time and may change the data.
A race-condition is a condition in which the critical section (a part of the program where shared memory is accessed)
is concurrently executed by two or more threads. It leads to incorrect behavior of a program.
In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to
get certain shared resources.
For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error

To solve the data inconsistency problem in java synchronized keyword is used.
So the thread-safety is achieved and race condition is avoided by the help of synchronized keyword.

 
 
 
 
 Note: The synchronized keyword applicable only for methods and blocks but not for variables and classes.
If a method or block is declared as synchronized then at a time only one thread is allowed to execute that method or
block on a given object so that data inconsistency problem will be resolved.
The main advantage of the synchronized keyword is we can resolve data inconsistency problem. but the main
disadvantage of the synchronized keyword is it increases waiting time of the threads and creates performance
problem on it. hence if there is no specific requirement then it is never recommended to use the synchronized
keyword.
Example:
checking seat availability method should be non-synchronized, where as book seat method should be
synchronized
Any method that changes the state of an object. i.e. add/update/delete/replace method we should use as
synchronized.





If very few lines of the code requires synchronization then it is not recommended to declare entire method as
synchronized. we have to enclose those few lines of the code in synchronized block.
In a method, assume 10000 lines code is there, and in the middle somewhere few line need some Database
operation like(update/delete/add) then declaring entire method as synchronized is a worst kind of programming. here
it degrades the performance.
The main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is ,it reduces the waiting time of the threads
and improves the performance of the application.
