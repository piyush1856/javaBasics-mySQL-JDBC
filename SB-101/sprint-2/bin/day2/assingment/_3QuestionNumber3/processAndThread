Differentiate between process and thread : 


Multitasking:
Multitasking is the process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU.
Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:




1. Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
2. Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
 
Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing):
Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
A process is heavy weight.
The cost of communication between the process is high.
Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps,
updating lists, etc.



Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading):
Threads share the same address space.(a thread is a part of a process)
A thread is lightweight.
The cost of communication between the thread is low.


Note: At least one process is required for each thread.
