What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in
parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A
simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
But, if the programming language supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
in parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are
used to achieve multitasking.
However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't
allocate separate memory areas so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than
process.



Advantages of Java Multithreading:
1. It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the
same time.
2. You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
3. Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
