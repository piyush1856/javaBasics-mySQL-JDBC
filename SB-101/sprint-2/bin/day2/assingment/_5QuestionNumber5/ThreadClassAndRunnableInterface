Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?


Thread class and Runnable interface are the two structures using which we implement Thread based
multitasking in java.

Note: Internally the Thread class implements the Runnable interface and override run() method with empty
implementation.

Runnable Interface : (By Implementing)
The signature of a function using which we implement a thread is defined in an interface by the name Runnable.
This Runnable interface belongs to java.lang package. it has only one abstract method : run()
Inside this run() method we need to define the functionality, that we want to execute as a thread along with the main
thread. after providing the body we need to execute this functionality as a thread (i.e. simultaneously with the other
part of the program)


Thread Class : (By Extending)
There is a class by the name Thread present in java.lang package, which has a method called start(), this start()
method is used to execute a given functionality defined inside the run() method of Runnable interface as a separate
thread.
This start() method of the Thread class recognize the run() method of the Runnable interface and then the run()
method is executed as a separate individual thread.


Note:-weather we extends Thread class or implement Runnable interface directly, we have to use run()
method of the Runnable interface.
